#  Retail Insights: Data-Driven Cost Savings & Revenue Growth

> DSTI Applied MSc Project | Instacart Online Grocery Dataset

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 3M+ grocery orders to provide actionable recommendations for shop owners:
- **Association Rule Mining** (Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, UP-Tree)
- **Customer Segmentation** (RFM + KMeans)
- **Revenue Simulation** from data-driven product bundles
- **Promotion ROI** — targeted vs. blanket discounts

- # Grocery Store Data Analysis

### What I Did
I analyzed a dataset of 50,000 orders to understand customer behavior. Using Python and SQL, I calculated which products are most popular and which departments see the most traffic.

### Key Insights
* **Customer Loyalty:** 60% of top-selling items are organic.
* **Basket Size:** Most customers buy between 5 and 10 items per trip.
* **Top Department:** The Produce department accounts for the highest volume of sales.

### How to navigate this project
* All raw and cleaned data can be found in the [data folder](./data)

## Quick Start
Step 0: Database Infrastructure
Before running the code, you must initialize the database:

Open your Supabase SQL Editor.
Copy and run the contents of database_setup.sql.
This creates the optimized B-Tree indexes and the product_details view.

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download dataset
Go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data  
Download all CSV files into `data/raw/`

Required files:
- `orders.csv`
- `order_products__prior.csv`
- `order_products__train.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `aisles.csv`
- `departments.csv`

### 3. Run the ML pipeline
```bash
python pipeline.py
```
Or open `notebooks/pipeline.ipynb` in Jupyter.

### 4. Launch the dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Methods

| Module | Algorithms |
|--------|-----------|
| Association Rules | Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat |
| Utility Mining | UP-Tree (value-aware rules) |
| Segmentation | RFM Analysis + KMeans (k=4) |
| Revenue Model | Lift-based simulation |
| Promotion Analysis | Targeted vs. Blanket discount P&L |

## Team Roles

| Role | Task |
|------|------|
| Data Engineer | Data pipeline, merging, price enrichment |
| Data Scientist A | Association rule mining |
| Data Scientist B | Segmentation + utility mining |
| Business Analyst | Dashboard + report + demo video |

## Dashboard Pages

1. **Overview** — KPIs, top products, algorithm comparison
2. **Customer Segments** — RFM clusters, scatter maps, basket variability
3. **Product Associations** — Interactive rule explorer with filters
4. **Revenue Simulation** — Bundle ROI calculator with sliders
5. **Promotion ROI** — Targeted vs. blanket discount analysis

## Results & Recommendations
1. **Customer Purchase Behavior**
   - **Order Frequency**: Segmentation analysis revealed two dominant ordering patterns: weekly shoppers (average 7-day reorder cycle) and monthly bulk buyers (approximately 30-day cycle).
   - **Basket Size**: Weekly customers typically purchase 5–7 items per order, whereas monthly customers tend to purchase 16–25 items per transaction.
   - **Customer Segments**: Using RFM clustering, customers were grouped into two primary segments:
     - Champions: High frequency, high spending customers.
     - Regular Buyers: High frequency but lower spending customers.
   These insights suggest different promotional strategies should be applied depending on customer type.

2. **Product & Category Insights**
   The most frequently purchased products include:
   - Bananas
   - Bag of Organic Bananas
   - Limes
   - Large Lemins
   - Organic Strawberries
   - Organic Whole Milk
   - Organic Hass Avocado
   These products are primarily concentrated within the Fruits and Vegetables category, highlighting strong demand for fresh produce.

3. **Key Strategic Insights**
   - Targeted Growth Strategy: Regular buyers should be offered low-cost discovery promotions (e.g., 5% bundle discounts) to gradually increase basket size without eroding margins.
   - Citrus Bundle Opportunity: Limes and large lemons co-occur in 1 out of every 20 baskets. However, 61% of customers purchasing limes do not purchase lemons. A targeted “Citrus Bundle” could convert this missed cross-selling opportunity.
   - Targeted vs Blanket Discounting: Blanket discounts (e.g., 15% for all customers) reduce margins unnecessarily. Targeted promotions directed at specific segments generate higher ROI and more efficient revenue growth.
   - Cross-Sell Optimization: Implementing a “Frequently Bought Together” feature at checkout can increase cross-selling and average basket value.
   - Product Placement Strategy: Reposition high-performing bundles together and phase out consistently low-performing products to optimize inventory turnover and shelf space utilization.

## Business Impact

   This project enables retailers to:
   - Improve cross-sell strategies using high-lift and high-utility bundles.
   - Increase promotion efficiency through targeted discounting.
   - Reduce unnecessary margin erosion caused by blanket discounts.
   - Personalize promotional strategies based on customer segmentation.
   - Optimize product placement and category management.
  Overall, the findings demonstrate how data-driven retail analytics can increase basket size, improve promotional ROI, and drive sustainable revenue growth.
